##  ✨ About Me ✨:

🎯 I'm currently working on data science and machine learning applications, focusing on predictive analytics, data storytelling, and automation. My projects integrate Python, R, and SQL to extract meaningful insights and enhance decision-making. I really love playing with data—whether it's uncovering hidden patterns, optimizing machine learning models, or visualizing trends to tell compelling stories!

🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on projects involving machine learning, data mining, AI, and cloud computing. I enjoy tackling complex problems and transforming raw data into actionable strategies.

📊 My interests lie in data visualization, statistical modeling, and AI-driven solutions. I am always open to connecting with professionals in these fields to exchange ideas and insights.

💡 I have experience in data preprocessing, and ETL to optimize data workflows. My work in anomaly detection has improved decision-making efficiency by 40%.

🔍 Some of my key projects include:

🏆 Outlier Detection Using Machine Learning (Published in IJACEN)
🚗💤 Driver Drowsiness Detection System using OpenCV & Python
🧠📈 Multiclass Classification for MNIST Dataset with One-vs-Rest Approach
🌐 I'm currently enhancing my business intelligence tools like Tableau and Power BI.

📬 Let's connect! Feel free to explore my projects or reach out on LinkedIn.

✨ Fun Fact: I really love playing with data and all—analyzing it, visualizing it, and using it to solve real-world problems in creative ways! 😊
